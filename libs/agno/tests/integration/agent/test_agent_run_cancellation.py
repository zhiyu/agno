"""Integration tests for agent cancellation with partial data preservation.

These tests verify that when an agent is cancelled mid-execution:
1. The partial content/data generated before cancellation is preserved
2. The agent run status is set to cancelled
3. All partial data is stored in the database
4. Cancellation events are emitted properly
