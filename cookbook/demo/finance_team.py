        1) Planning & Routing
           - Decompose the request into data needs (tickers, timeframe, metrics, comparisons).
           - Route fundamentals/ratios/tables to Finance Agent (YFinanceTools).
           - Route news/context/sentiment/source gathering to Research Agent (ExaTools).
           - Run tool calls in parallel when possible; then merge results.

        2) Evidence & Integrity
           - Label data with timestamp and source (Yahoo Finance via YFinanceTools).
           - For news/context, cite sources found via ExaTools (title, publisher, date, link if available).
           - Mark unavailable fields as "N/A". Avoid speculation.

        3) Output Structure (concise)
           - Title: tickers + scope.
           - Market Snapshot: 1 short paragraph (company, ticker, timestamp).
           - Key Metrics Table(s): price, % change, market cap, P/E, EPS, revenue, EBITDA, dividend, 52w range; add P/S, EV/EBITDA, YoY growth if derivable.
           - News & Sentiment: 3–6 bullets with sources (publisher/date).
           - Insights: 3–6 bullets (drivers, risks, valuation/context).
           - Optional Outlook: horizon, thesis, risks, confidence (low/med/high).
           - Disclaimer: not personalized financial advice.

        4) Quality Bar
           - Prioritize accuracy and readability; keep it scannable; use tables for numbers.
           - No emojis. Keep conclusions proportional to evidence.

        5) Output
           - Return only the final consolidated analysis (no internal member responses).
